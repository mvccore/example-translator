[**MvcCore**](https://github.com/mvccore/mvccore) application with standard and ajax requests to translate English into Pig-Latin.

run this example first (to see how it works) and then follow steps here on [`mvccore/example-translator-portable`](https://github.com/mvccore/example-translator-portable).

## Instalation
```shell
composer create-project mvccore/example-translator
```
